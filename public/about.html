<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Abdelrahman Mohamed. I am a web developer and a computer science student. I grew up in a small neighborhood in Sudan. Even with the limited technology available in the country, I fell in love with computers from childhood.</p>

<p>As a web developer and copywriter, I like being able to catch people's eyes. I'm highly confident in my abilities. I dream of helping as many people as possible. I love my family. I enjoy playing sand volleyball and going to the gym. I'm outgoing. I like exploring the world. I like meeting new people and working in teams. My biggest dream is to reach my deathbed and yell, "Yeah, I did everything I wanted to do!" </p>

<p>I enjoy creating projects that benefit people. I enjoy writing and reading books. If you're reading this, I'm proud of you! I hope to see you smile. :)</p>
