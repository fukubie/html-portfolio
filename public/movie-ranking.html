<h1>The Best Movies According to Abdo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie. It taught me to never give up on my dreams, no matter what obstacles I encounter in life. The film evoked strong emotions throughout, and I ended up in tears. I highly recommend it!</p>
<h3>They Live</h3>
<p>I was once scrolling through social media when I came across a scene where a guy put on his glasses and saw a whole new world. He saw reality. I loved the idea of being in a limited world and trying to escape it. I loved the vibe because it reminded me of The Matrix movie.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>As a child, I dreamed of seeing and exploring space. But what if there are bad creatures out there trying to hunt you? This movie makes you happy about something you find, but then you realize it's not what you thought. I like it.</p>
